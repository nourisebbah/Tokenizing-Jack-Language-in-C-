# JackAnalyzer – Project 11

This project is part of my Nand2Tetris journey Project 11, where the goal is to enhance the parser to generate VM code instead of XML from the Jack language.

Take .jack source files ➔ parse the tokens ➔ and generate corresponding VM code for each part of the Jack program.
